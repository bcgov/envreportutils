- `multiplot()` - combine multiple `ggplot2` plots into one
- `bgc_colours` - get colour codes for B.C. Biogeoclimatic (BGC) Zones
- `get_data_license` - get the url, or a markdown or html-formatted link to one of several B.C. or Candadian licenses
- `order_df` - order a df using summary of another column or specify the order manually
